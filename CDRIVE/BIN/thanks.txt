Hello Professor Vulis 

Thank you for a wonderful semester! I really enjoyed your class. (well both your classes!)
Im excited to hopefully take CSC 420 next semester with you.
I appreicate how you are realisitc about everything. If something is not so important you tell us and dont make belive like it is 
just because the course requires the you too. 
Your style of teaching with projects is perfect. It really lets us have a hands on pratice to programming.
I also appreciate that you choose projects that are fun and interesting; It really makes working on it so much more enjoyable. 

Once again thank you!

Sincerly,
