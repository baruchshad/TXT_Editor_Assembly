MAKING YOUR OWN ASSEMBLY GAME

The process is fairly similar to running my game that I included. Make sure you first set up the dosbox.conf file as explained above!

1 - You would have to first program your game in Assembly (.asm file extension) and then make sure to save it in the \bin folder.
2 - Run DOSBOX.EXE
3 - type *run *YOUR ASM FILE NAME** and hit ENTER.
This will automatiically compile and link your code and start it.
